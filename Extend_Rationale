Process Writing for Extend-Unit:
What?: It extends immediate values to 32-bits.
How?: It loads an output bus with earlier values, repeating the final bit of the final immediate for an accurately signed value.
Why?: So that operations on them may be performed and stored into registers.

Problem: Based on the selection bit, how to select a specific operation/configuration?

    Solution: Case-When statement (Multiplexer).

Problem: When the selection bit is out of the 5 standard options (I, S, B, U, J types), what is output?

    Solution: all 'X' signals, as it will allow for error catching, but now makes program more volatile. Otherwise, all '0' would maybe also work, yet harder to catch.

Problem: Extending. General format

    Solution: for 0 to ... loop to set carried immediates, starting to reading input from (start_point + i), otherwise extended bit is duplicated in loop.

Problem: Many mentions arithmetic shift option

    Solution: temporarily ignore, as theoretical CPU being built does not make use of such code.
